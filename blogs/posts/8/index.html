        <p><em><strong>3:30 PM</strong></em></p>
<p>I am at work in the office. I've fixed a production issue in the frontend code and have just finished scheduling a production release for later that evening. I've got nothing planned for later. So I go to the parking lot, zoom out of the office on my bike and call it a day.</p>
<p><em><strong>3:45 PM</strong></em></p>
<p>I'm on the bike, with ear pods on, playing random songs on repeat, on my way home. A thought strikes me.</p>
<p>I've got half a bottle of water, one chocolate bar, a good pair of shoes on, fuel inside the tank of a fully functioning bike, a partially functioning smartphone(that's another story) and time on my hand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why not go on a little adventure? Out of the four directions from which I could exit Bangalore, I chose the nearest option available - south.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>4:15 PM</strong></em></p>
<p>I am speeding through the NICE Bangalore-Mysore expressway at 100kmph, overtaking trucks and conquering mini-vans, while songs still played in my earpods. I now have two options to exit the highway, namely through Kanakpura road, or Bannerghatta road. I chose Kanakpura road - the one farther away.</p>
<p><em><strong>5:00 PM</strong></em></p>
<p>I'm out of the expressway and on the way to exit bangalore from the south, through Kanakpura.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, where do I go from here?&quot;</p>
<p>Lakes and hills passed by and the road is straight. That makes my decision easy.</p>
<p>I continue straight then take a break in Kanakpura.</p>
<p><em><strong>5:40 PM</strong></em></p>
<p>Break's over, it's getting dark and I have to make another decision. Go further south, or look for some uncharted trail nearby to see what I can find.</p>
<p>I can't decide... so I did both. I went south and found the nearest hill I could possibly enter with my bike. It was named &quot;Bananthimari&quot;.</p>
<p><em><strong>6:00 PM</strong></em></p>
<p>After spinning my wheels through the narrow and curvy trails and a little bit of off-roading, I reach the end of the hill road.</p>
<p>There's a little temple there with it's door closed, the ground soiled with wet mud and rocks. Behind the temple, is a picturesque landscape of all the neighbouring mountains and lakes. On the other side, is a forest trek.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Forest Area - Entry Restricted&quot;, read a signpost in vain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clouds start to cover up the sunset, the winds are strong and warm. There is about 15 mins of daylight left.
Eerie bassy noises from inside the forest, no sign of human life.</p>
<p><em><strong>6:05 PM</strong></em></p>
<p>Anyways, I prop up my phone onto a slit in one of the rocks, and take some pictures.</p>
<p><a href="https://freeimage.host/i/JscZyBa"><img src="https://iili.io/JscZyBa.md.jpg" alt="JscZyBa.md.jpg"></a></p>
<p><em><strong>6:10 PM</strong></em></p>
<p>The decrease in sunlight is rapid and it's getting darker by the second. I hear birds chirping, monkeys flying around tree branches above me. Animal noises from the off the trails inside the jungle still continue.</p>
<p>Looks like I have company. Something lurked beneath the bushes in front of the me and I can't see it. It's getting spooky real fast - just the way I like it.</p>
<p><em><strong>6:15 PM</strong></em></p>
<p>I trail further into the uncharted woods. The noise I heard earlier is now louder and sharper from my left. I stop suddenly, not because of the noise but because of something I found on the ground right in front of me.</p>
<p><a href="https://freeimage.host/i/Jscte6J"><img src="https://iili.io/Jscte6J.md.jpg" alt="Jscte6J.md.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Bear pawprints. Fresh.</p>
<p>As I stare into the distance through the bushes, keeping an eye out for a potential beast staring back at me, I feel a strong cold breeze on my face. A friendly warning from nature perhaps.</p>
<p>It's time to go back.</p>
<p><em><strong>6:40 PM</strong></em></p>
<p>I'm back out of the forest trail, and near my bike. It's now dark. Flies everywhere. I start my journey back home.</p>
<p><em><strong>6:50 PM</strong></em></p>
<p>Off-roading back through rocky, silty, muddy, wet trails on a 150cc commuter bike with limited headlamp vision range. Good times.</p>
<p><em><strong>7:15 PM</strong></em></p>
<p>Back on the highway, then Kanakpura.</p>
<p><em><strong>8:50 PM</strong></em></p>
<p>Back to Bangalore, with another story to tell.</p>
<p>cheers!</p>
